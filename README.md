This is the repository of Ulrich Anders.

I am going to use ~~Python~~ Markdown in this class. **Markdown** is great.

The class is at [CBS](https://cbs.de).

We are going to learn:

- How digital organizations work.
- What modern types of organizations exist.
- Present in the browser.

We are also pretending we are developers, because:

1. we use the CLI.
1. we will make a presentation in the browser.
1. we are cool and make only hand-written graphs that we have developed
   ourselves.
1. we learn about the GitHub workflow.
